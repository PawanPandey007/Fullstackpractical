          HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely
          used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which
          Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link
          available on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML
          is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a
          text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to
          display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining
          the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so
          forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
          researchers.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
           HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
          HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
